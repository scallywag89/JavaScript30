# JavaScript30 Challenge!

### Day One - JS Drumkit 🥁 :
---
**Today I learned about:**
- [x] Data attributes
- [x] Event Listeners
- [x] Transition events

I went a bit off-piste and changed the drumkit to a Keyboard 🎹 that lets you play a C major scale.
You can select the Major or Minor button and it will change the output sound. 

It's definitely a pretty rudimentary way of doing it (just hiding the buttons depending on what is selected), but fun nonetheless!
