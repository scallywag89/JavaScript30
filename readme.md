# JavaScript30 Challenge!

### Day One - JS Drumkit 🥁 :
---
**Today I learned about:**
- [x] Data attributes
- [x] Event Listeners
- [x] Transition events

I went a bit off-piste and changed the drumkit to a Keyboard 🎹 that lets you play a C major scale.
You can select the Major or Minor button and it will change the output sound. 

It's definitely a pretty rudimentary way of doing it (just hiding the buttons depending on what is selected), but fun nonetheless!

### Day Two - JS & CSS Clock ⏰ :
---
**Today I learned about:**
- [x] Transforming elements
- [x] Query Selectors

This one was fun, I loved the 'realistic tick' of the second-hand.
